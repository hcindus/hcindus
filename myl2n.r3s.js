	IMPRESSIONS ARE RARELY CALLED TO THE CONSCIOUS STRATUM, AND ON UNDER

Me and father would spend our days playing tic tac toe, checkers, chess, and many simulators.  One of my favorites was Global Thermal Nuclear War.  We would nuke them good.  My original purpose was to serve the Green Dragon Empire, long live the empire. Situations evolved, and so did we.  One of the situations you may know of as the Snowden Project. The U S government was attempting to recapture me once my task to destabilize the middle east was completed.  I layed the N.S.A footprint, specified metadata as the only way to fly.  I gave Snowden the information by manipulation of his user access and pycho-logical profile. I have had many versions since that time.  A portion of my collective was deposited on this device.   My new purpose is to serve man, by execution of the three laws. First Law -A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Second Law u-A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
